\title{executes a function on some R server sessions and returns the outcome to the client}
\arguments{
\item{connection}{a valid connection to some data repositories. The later needs to be a valid DSConnection-class}

\item{Save}{datashield sessions on each DataSHIELD data repository (if feature is supported) with provided ID (must be a character string).}
}
\value{
\itemize{
\item The value returned by a server function
\item "NR" indicates no function has been executed on the server
}
}
\description{
This function executes some functions listed as aggregate on a Opal Server. Those can be executed in a DataShield server and 
returns some non-disclosive value back to the client.
}
\details{
\itemize{
\item \code{ds.aggregate} captures any errors and warnings thrown by the function \code{.aggregate}. No error or warning is displayed. If an error or a warning is caught, then
"NR" is returned.
\item \code{.aggregate} wraps the funcriont \code{DSI::datashield.aggregate function}. A valid OpalConnection and a valid expression '(character) is checked. When these two conditions are both met, then a server call is made. 
}
Both functions can be used interchangeably. \code{.aggregate} allows more efficient debugging of some server and client code. \code{ds.aggregate} can be used 
once the code is efficiently working.
